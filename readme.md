# Country Roads Sega Master System Demo
A simple American country side with a PSG cover of Take Me Home, Country Roads used as practice
for raster effects, audio implementation, and music arrangement for the Sega Mark III/Sega Master System.

You're missing the best part by just watching this GIF... so why not download the ROM and try it out!

### Project History
This is a project that I worked on with my friend, Marghe, on the side during development of 
another Sega Master System/Mark III game. I'd never had any pratice with adding
sound or music to a game, and since she is a professional musician, I figured I'd
ask for help in th audio department.  

However, since it was her first time working with an old game console, she wanted to
try converting something she already knew and liked, so she decided on the song
Country Roads by Bill Danoff, Taffy Nivert and John Denver. Once she was finished, I needed
to figure out how to actually get the song to play on a Master System or Mark III, and instead
of just having a blank screen play the song, I decided that I would turn it into a cute little
country roads driving scene, and this was the result!  

### Known Issues
I haven't had any issues with it running on emulator (specifically emulicious), and it also works
great on my Japanese Mega Drive model 2 (which is where I captured footage for the gifs in this repository).
However, every time I load it onto my Master Everdrive, the first time I run it on my Sega Mark III, the 
HBlank interval gets messed up and ruins the scrolling the first time I try and run it. Everytime after that
though it runs perfectly fine on the real hardware.
